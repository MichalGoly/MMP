# About the Outline Project Specification templates
An alterantive BibTeX style file has been added - IEEEannotU.bst. This is based on the IEEEannot.bst file, but has removed the sorting that was used to sort the names of authors in the bibliography. The IEEEannotU.bst file will show items in the order they are cited in the main document.  

If you have already started to use this template, you need to make a small change to use IEEEannotU. In the example tex file, you will see the following on line 85: 

    \bibliographystyle{IEEEannotU}
    
Make this change in your own LaTeX file.
